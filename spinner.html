<h1>Spinner</h1>
<p>This is a 2D one-player game I am creating with GameMaker involving an aircraft flying through
rings which cause the aircraft to speed up and begin to rotate. The more consecutive rings the
player makes it through, the faster the aircraft will move. Each time the 
player misses a ring, the aircraft will slow down dramatically. If the player misses too many 
rings the aircraft will crash.</p>
