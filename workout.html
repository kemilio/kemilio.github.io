<h1>Workout Tracker</h1>
<p>This Android application will catalog two forms of workouts: <strong>Weight Training</strong> 
and <strong>Cardiovascular Exercise</strong>.
<p><strong>Weight Training</strong>
<p>This option will allow you to track your lifting repetitions and sets by organizing them based
on the kind of lifting technique (i.e. curls, benchpress) you are doing. You will be able to pick from 
a pre-set list of techniques or have the option of creating your own if you can't find yours.
Furthermore, the app will compare your current workout to previous ones to determine if you are 
improving or not.
<p><strong>Cardiovascular</strong>
<p>This option will allow you to track your endurance and calorie consumption based on a pre-set list of 
cardiovascular exercises including jogging, biking, walking and elliptical. Endurance improvement will
be based on duration and intensity of the exercise.</p>
