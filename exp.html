	    <strong>Professional History</strong><br><br>
	    <u>Baird</u><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I primarily pair with one of the four other software developers on my team and work through tasks of varying difficulty. 
These can range from anywhere between support tickets for automated software that fixes itself on the next scheduled run to totally 
overhauling outdated, inefficient code and rewriting it in a more modern language within a time crunch. I also create SQL Server Reporting 
Service (SSRS) reports at the request and specifications given from business users. Our team is heavily invested in SCRUM and Test Driven 
Development, and we have daily stand-ups to report on and discuss our current status in our work queue. Every piece of software I've seen 
includes a variety of tests in their test suites, primarily structured with XUnit testing in Visual Studio.</div><br>

		    <u>Space, Science and Engineering Center (UW-Madison)</u><br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I monitered the servers in the data center by doing hourly checks on data streams via satellite and nightly physical 
	    walkthroughs through the server room. I also performed maintenance on the SSEC website by renewing aging pages and updating
		information. During my time at SSEC, I trained and supervised four new Data Analysts.
