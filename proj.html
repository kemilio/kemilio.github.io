	<strong>Website Template Program (Ruby)</strong><br>
	This program will allow users to create their own websites using a point-and-click interface with pre-determined templates. The
	public will access the front-end interface of the site and developers/administrators will be able to access a backend for 
	changing features. It will be developed on an Ubuntu virtual machine using EngineX with Ruby and will utilize MariaDB. The 
	program is in early stages of development and is subject to change going forward.

	<strong>Diabetes Tracking App (JavaScript, HTML & CSS)</strong><br>
	This app utilizes Google Firebase to allow a user to sign up for or log into a registered account, queries the Firebase Realtime 
	Database to extract user-defined information and stores user data into the database. The app was written primarily in JavaScript
	with Node.js on the Express framework with some HTML and CSS for web-based GUI's and data passing. This app was written as a
	project for a winterim class and some of the code (controllers, html pages) was pre-written for the class.</div><br>

	<strong>Sorting Algorithms Timer (Written in Java, converted to C#)</strong><br>
	This program utilizes a variety of different sorting algorithms (QuickSort, BubbleSort, etc) to sort a random assortment of integers
	inside of an array object from least to greatest. The user of the program can choose the size of the array and which method to sort 
	it with, and when finished the program will give you the first 200 elements of the array as well as the time it took to sort.
	The program is written in an object-oriented fashion with the five principles of SOLID (Single Responsbility Principle, Open/Closed
	Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle) in mind when relevant.
	The program was originally written in Java but was converted to C# due to the ease of GUI and desktop application creation with 
	Visual Studio.</div><br>
	
<div class="para">
	<strong>Romanizer (C#)</strong><br>
	This program converts Arabic numbers and converts them to Roman numerals, or vice versa. This program was designed to be an 
	exercise in test-driven development; most lines of code were written from a test case that had to be passed.</div><br>
	
<div class="para">
	<strong>eScavenge (Python)</strong><br>
	This program establishes a web server (via Django) and allows users to create a virtual scavenger hunt. It includes two classes
	of users: the GameMaker and the teams of players. The GameMaker can create "landmarks" which contain a "clue" that each team must
	guess correctly in order to progress to the next landmark. Guess wrong or take too long and you may be penalized.The team that 
	finishes first and/or has the fewest penalties wins the game. This program was written as part of a team project in a semester-
	long class.</div>
