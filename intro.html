I am a Senior-level student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee studying Computer Science with the intention to graduate in the 
spring of 2018. I am also a software development intern at Baird. I have experience in various programming languages, including Java, 
JavaScript, Python, C#, C++, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, MatLab, ML and Prolog. In addition to my prowess in pure software, I also have had 
experience with frameworks, IDE's and other tools such as Eclipse, Visual Studio (2013, 2015 and 2017), Node.js (via Express), Google 
FireBase, Linux (via shell scripting with Bash), Windows PowerShell and Windows SQL Server 2016. </div>

Previous to my enrollment at UWM, I was a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from which I graduated with a degree in 
Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. In opposition to the clich√©, I actually enjoy talking about the weather. I also enjoy video games, 
reading, practicing my guitar (poorly), exercising and binge watching Netflix with my wife.</div>
