<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div class="para">
<p> I am a Senior-level student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee studying Computer Science with the intention to graduate in the 
spring of 2018. I am also a software development intern at Baird. I have experience in various programming languages, including Java, 
JavaScript, Python, C#, C++, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, MatLab, ML and Prolog. In addition to my prowess in pure software, I also have had 
experience with frameworks, IDE's and other tools such as Eclipse, Visual Studio (2013, 2015 and 2017), Node.js (via Express), Google 
FireBase, Linux (via shell scripting with Bash), Windows PowerShell and Windows SQL Server 2016. <br>
At Baird, I primarily pair with one of the four other software developers on my team and work through tasks of varying difficulty. 
These can range from anywhere between support tickets for automated software that fixes itself on the next scheduled run to totally 
overhauling outdated, inefficient code and rewriting it in a more modern language within a time crunch. I also create SQL Server Reporting 
Service (SSRS) reports at the request and specifications given from business users. Our team is heavily invested in SCRUM and Test Driven 
Development, and we have daily stand-ups to report on and discuss our current status in our work queue. Every piece of software I've seen 
includes a variety of tests in their test suites, primarily structured with XUnit testing in Visual Studio.<br>
Previous to my enrollment at UWM, I was a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from which I graduated with a degree in 
Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. In opposition to the clich√©, I actually enjoy talking about the weather. I also enjoy video games, 
reading, practicing my guitar (badly), exercising and binge watching Netflix with my wife. </p>

<p>In case you're in a hurry, heres a nice little bar graph to describe my software skills with concision.</p>
